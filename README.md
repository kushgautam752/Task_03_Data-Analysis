# üõí Retail Orders Database ‚Äì Querying Fundamentals  

## üìå Project Overview  
This project is part of my **SQL learning journey** where I worked with a **mock retail dataset** to practice SQL fundamentals.  
The dataset simulates a retail business with customers, products, orders, and order items.  

The goal was to apply **basic SQL operations** like `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, `GROUP BY`, and `JOIN` to extract meaningful insights.

## üìÇ Dataset Structure  
The dataset contains 4 CSV files:  

1. **customers.csv** ‚Äì Customer details (ID, name, email, city, state)  
2. **products.csv** ‚Äì Product details (ID, name, category, price)  
3. **orders.csv** ‚Äì Order details (ID, customer, order date, total amount)  
4. **order_items.csv** ‚Äì Items in each order (ID, order, product, quantity, price)

## üõ†Ô∏è SQL Schema (PostgreSQL)  

```sql
CREATE TABLE customers (
    customer_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    email VARCHAR(100),
    city VARCHAR(50),
    state VARCHAR(50)
);

CREATE TABLE products (
    product_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    product_name VARCHAR(100),
    category VARCHAR(50),
    price DECIMAL(10,2)
);

CREATE TABLE orders (
    order_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_id INT REFERENCES customers(customer_id),
    order_date DATE,
    total_amount DECIMAL(12,2)
);

CREATE TABLE order_items (
    order_item_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    order_id INT REFERENCES orders(order_id),
    product_id INT REFERENCES products(product_id),
    quantity INT,
    price DECIMAL(10,2)
);

--SELECT Basics--
SELECT customer_id, name, city 
FROM customers;

--Filtering with WHERE--
SELECT * 
FROM customers 
WHERE city = 'Delhi';

SELECT order_id, total_amount 
FROM orders 
WHERE total_amount > 5000;

--Sorting with ORDER BY--
SELECT order_id, total_amount 
FROM orders 
ORDER BY total_amount DESC 
LIMIT 10;

--Aggregations with GROUP BY--
--Find total sales per customer:--
SELECT customer_id, SUM(total_amount) AS total_spent
FROM orders
GROUP BY customer_id
ORDER BY total_spent DESC;
--Find number of orders per city:--
SELECT c.city, COUNT(o.order_id) AS order_count
FROM customers c
JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
GROUP BY c.city
ORDER BY order_count DESC;

--JOINs--
SELECT o.order_id, p.product_name, oi.quantity, oi.price
FROM orders o
JOIN order_items oi ON o.order_id = oi.order_id
JOIN products p ON oi.product_id = p.product_id;

--Date Functions--
SELECT order_id, order_date, total_amount
FROM orders
WHERE EXTRACT(MONTH FROM order_date) = 1
  AND EXTRACT(YEAR FROM order_date) = 2025;
